#tributary.js
    This is the meat of the code for tributary and all the views. This provides the Backbone model which drives the live code functionality.


#views
The views are the different endpoints of tributary which give us a different view of the code being developed. Each view extends the base tributary model and adds it's own assumptions.

#lib
The many js libraries tributary includes

#css
The stylesheets

#img
Static image assets

#java
experimental inclusion for doing MIDI in the browser

#svgs
experimental area for some svgs I was playing with.

#gallery.json
old way of generating a dynamic gallery, may revist
